# NoteSkin Selector Remastered
NoteSkin Selector Remastered; new layout, new code, and more customizability.

## About
This is a completely remastered one of my old mods "NoteSkin Selector", created in 2022. This mod heavily improves and enhances everything from the old mod. It includes a new friendlier GUI layout for selecting skins more easily, a better optimized and organized code. Basically, a more improved version of the current built-in noteskin system in the engine, because that one sucks ass ngl.

> [!NOTE]
> The Noteskin Debug State is temporarily removed for reasons. Because I wanna rush it out becuase it has been almost a year without an update. And making an editor is the most hardest part, so cut me some slack here. This will be re-added back in the version 3.0.0.
