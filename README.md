# NoteSkin Selector Remastered
NoteSkin Selector Remastered; new layout, new code, and more customizability.

## About
This is a remastered of my old mods "NoteSkin Selector", one my old shitty mods created in 2022. It heavily improves everything from the old mod. It includes a new friendlier GUI layout for selecting skins more easily, a better clean and organized code, and basically, and a more improved version of the current built-in noteskin system in the engine, because that one sucks ass ngl.

## Installation Requirements
1. Computer
2. Psych Engine 1.0.0 (Pre-Release)
3. Should be inside the `mods` folder; without renaming the mod folder
