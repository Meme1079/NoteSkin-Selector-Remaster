# Introduction
A Remastered of NoteSkin Selector!, one of my old shitty scripts. This new and improve script allows you to select your note/splash skins in an easy and fast way. And heavily improves the current built-in noteskin system in the engine, because that one sucks ass. It can also be used for making note packs easily.

# QNA
1. ***How do I add Noteskins?***
     - If you already installed the noteskin you wanted. Rename the file name with the prefix `NOTE_assets-` followed by the name; Example: `NOTE_assets-Funny`. It should be inside of `images/noteSkins` folder.
2. ***How do I access it?***
     - Go to any song and press Tab, it will sent you to the noteskin state. If you want to re-enter the current song you're playing just press Tab again.
3. ***Why isn't the splash skin finished?***
     - It will be in a later update mainly version `2.0.0` of it. But I'll have to do version `1.5.0`, it's just for polishing stuff and maybe even adding "extra stuff".
