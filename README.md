# NoteSkin Selector Remastered
NoteSkin Selector Remastered; new layout, new code, and more customizability.

## About
This is a completely remastered one of my old mods "NoteSkin Selector", created in 2022. This mod heavily improves and enhances everything from the old mod. It includes a new friendlier GUI layout for selecting skins more easily, a better optimized and organized code. Basically, a more improved version of the current built-in noteskin system in the engine, because that one sucks ass ngl.

## Version 2.0.0
### Additions/Changes
- Overhual the main GUI with a new redesign, cuz it looks cool. _(inspired by OreUI from Minecraft)_
- Overhual the main source-code of the mod for organization and an ability to soft-code new skin states.
     - Classes to create custom states for different skins by using inheritance and polymorphism stuff.
     - Loads separated chunks of object sprites of the skins when switching pages.
- Additions/Changes on the NoteSkin Selector State.
     - Added a functional slider for switching skin pages.
          - It automatically snaps to its nearest page index.
          - It also automatically disables itself if there's only currently `1` page index.
     - Added an implementation for custom skin packs
          - Subfolders for the textures of skins within the skin packs (images folder)
          - Subfolders for certain metadata JSON files within the skin packs (json folder)
     - Added a functional search bar for finding certain skins.
          - Automatically filters to the closest skin it can find.
     - Increase the skin grid selections from `3x4` to `4x4`, cuz it's better.
- Organized file locations.
     - Added an `api` folder to group: `classes`, `libraries`, and `modules` for convenient sake.
     
> [!NOTE]
> The Noteskin Debug State is temporarily removed for reasons. Because I wanna rush it out becuase it has been almost a year without an update. And making an editor is the most hardest part, so cut me some slack here. This will be re-added back in v3.0.0.
